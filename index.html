        *NOTE* John's audio cuts out at 12:00, due to his microphone having issues that day. Essentially all that was said at that point was that along with the new feature of adding an expense with the barcode scanner, we also have updated the code and design of our stock tracker and stockview and we also show the existing 75% finished implementation of the Naive Bayes Text Classification that involves 2 datasets from publicly available sources which compile consumer spending data. These were pre-processed into a bag of words format using Python and exported so we can use them on android for our Naive Bayes Text Classifier. Due to technical constraints with Machine Learning in Kotlin, we were unable to implement multi-class text classification, but we settled on doing binary class classification. Unfortunately due to time-constraints, we had to leave this feature unfinished.
